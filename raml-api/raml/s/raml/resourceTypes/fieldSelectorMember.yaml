      Many of our resources allow you to specify what fields you want returned. We call this syntax field selectors.
      By indicating exactly the information you need, we can optimize the amount of time needed to return your results.
      It also reduces the amount of data passing across the wire. The two combine to make our APIs speedy and efficient,
      a critical factor in any web application, and more so for anyone relying on external APIs.

      Field selectors are specified after the resource identifiers and path components of a resource, prefixed by a colon,
      contained within parenthesis, and separated by commas. Fields will be returned in the order specified. When URL-encoding
      your resource URLs, ensure that the parenthesis used in selectors remain unescaped.

      Examples
      --------
      To get a member's ID, first name, last name, and industry:
        `http://api.startupsass.com/v1/people/~:(id,first-name,last-name,industry)`

      Or the same set of information for their connections:
        `http://api.startupsass.com/v1/people/~/connections:(id,first-name,last-name,industry)`

      Fields selectors can also be nested to access individual fields from a larger collection. For example, to get just the
      job titles and not the rest of the information about positions:
        `http://api.startupsass.com/v1/people/~/connections:(id,first-name,last-name,positions:(title))`

    example: ":(id,first-name,last-name,industry)"
